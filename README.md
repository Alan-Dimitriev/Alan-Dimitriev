I'm a Biomedical Computer Scientist with an interest in applying Machine Learning techniques to tackle medical problems. I have experience working with large scale public health data and genetic data. I am passionate about making a real difference in the lives of others, and aspire to use my technical knowledge to make the world a better place.

## Projects
#### [Reproduction of 'An Explainable CNN Approach for Medical Codes Prediction from Clinical Text'](https://github.com/Alan-Dimitriev/ReproducabilityStudyExplainableCNNs)  •  [Paper](https://github.com/Alan-Dimitriev/ReproducabilityStudyExplainableCNNs/blob/main/Report_Final.pdf)

We attempted to reproduce the methods and results reported in the 2021 paper [An Explainable CNN Approach for Medical Codes Prediction from Clinical Text](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12911-021-01615-6) by Hu et al.

#### [Using Evolutionary Computing To Find The Ideal Shaman Healing Spell Rotation In World of Warcraft](https://github.com/Alan-Dimitriev/EvolutionaryComputingWoWShaman)  •  [Paper](https://github.com/Alan-Dimitriev/EvolutionaryComputingWoWShaman/blob/main/CISC_851_FINAL_PROJECT.pdf)

This study proposes the creation of an evolutionary algorithm to find what the best single target healing spell rotation for shamans in World of Warcraft is based on percent healing generated over a given span of time.

#### [Breast Invasive Carcinoma MIRSEQ Analysis](https://github.com/Alan-Dimitriev/BICMA)  •  [Paper](https://github.com/Alan-Dimitriev/BICMA/blob/main/Breast_Invasive_Carcinoma_MIRSEQ_Analysis.pdf)
In this study we aim to investigate whether miRNAseq reads can be used as discriminating features of a binary pathological N stage classification system (whether or not a given patient’s cancer has spread to any nearby lymph nodes or none).

#### [NBA Wins-Made Predictions From College Stats](https://github.com/Alan-Dimitriev/NBA_WM_Predictions)  •  [Paper](https://github.com/Alan-Dimitriev/NBA_WM_Predictions/blob/main/NBA_Wins_Made_Report.pdf)
The aim of our project was to use machine learning to create a model that could accurately
predict the “Wins-Made” an NBA draft prospect would have contributed to an NBA roster based
off of their college basketball stats (such as points per game, assists and rebounds) and their NBA
draft combine measurements (such as height, wingspan, and vertical leaping ability).
